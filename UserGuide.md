## What is Zelda Ocarina of Time randomizer ?

This is a game released on Nintendo 64 in 1998 but in a randomized version. Thus, the items and songs in particular are no longer in the same places. The player will then have to think about the logic to be able to complete his seed (example "with what I know, my hookshot unlocks my bow etc").

## What is a Zelda Ocarina of Time randomizer tracker ?

With a tracker, you are able to note the items, medallions, stones and songs obtained. This tracker in particular makes it possible to note the places already visited, the keys obtained as well as to note the clues collected during the adventure. 
A character giving you an item or chest to open represents a check. If the check is red, the player cannot get the reward. Other items or songs are then needed for this. It will turn green as soon as all the prerequisites are met. In accordance with the rule enacted by the Zelda Speedrun community, the tracker does not analyze the logic of the seed. He is not able to know which bow was obtained first for example.
